# Belly_Button_Analysis

# Overview

Below is a completed dashboard from Roza. She has a completed panel for demographic information and visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.
